Transformers acts as the model-definition framework for state-of-the-art machine learning with text, computer
vision, audio, video, and multimodal models, for both inference and training.

It centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. `transformers` is the
pivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training
frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, ...),
and adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, ...) which leverage the model definition from `transformers`.

We pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be
simple, customizable, and efficient.

There are over 1M+ Transformers [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=trending) on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) you can use.

Explore the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/) today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.

## Installation

Transformers works with Python 3.10+, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 2.4+.

Create and activate a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.

```py
# venv
python -m venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
# uv
uv venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
```

Install Transformers in your virtual environment.

```py
# pip
pip install "transformers[torch]"

# uv
uv pip install "transformers[torch]"
```

Install Transformers from source if you want the latest changes in the library or are interested in contributing. However, the *latest* version may not be stable. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) if you encounter an error.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers

# pip
pip install '.[torch]'

# uv
uv pip install '.[torch]'
```

## Quickstart

Get started with Transformers right away with the [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial) API. The `Pipeline` is a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.

Instantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation. The model is downloaded and cached so you can easily reuse it again. Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.

```py
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B")
pipeline("the secret to baking a really good cake is ")
[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need? To make 2 cakes, you will need 2 cups of sugar.'}]
```

To chat with a model, the usage pattern is the same. The only difference is you need to construct a chat history (the input to `Pipeline`) between you and the system.

> [!TIP]
> You can also chat with a model directly from the command line, as long as [`transformers serve` is running](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/serving).
> ```shell
> transformers chat Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
> ```

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

chat = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sassy, wise-cracking robot as imagined by Hollywood circa 1986."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, can you tell me any fun things to do in New York?"}
]

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
response = pipeline(chat, max_new_tokens=512)
print(response[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```
